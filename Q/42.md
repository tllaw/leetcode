## Question Description
Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

### Examples
```
Input:  height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

Explanation: The below elevation map (marked as 'X') is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (marked as 'O') are being trapped.

| | | | | | | |X| | | | |
| | | |X|O|O|O|X|X|O|X| |
| |X|O|X|X|O|X|X|X|X|X|X|
-------------------------
|0|1|0|2|1|0|1|3|2|1|2|1|
```

### Constraints

- `n == height.length`
- 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- 0 <= `height[i]` <= 10<sup>5</sup>

## How to Solve

We fill in water level by level. First we have an initial elevation. Whenever each time we encounter a lower elevation, we fill in partial water first and ignore this part. If we encounter a higher elevation, we fill in all the water we can and then ignore this part.

Take a look at the following example, considering `height = [4,0,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,5,0,0,3]`:

**Step 1**

```
| | | | |
|X| | | |
|X| | | |
|X| | |X|
|X| | |X|
---------
|4|0|0|2|
```

First we have 2 elevations `4` and `2`. In this situation we first fill in water in this gap.

**Step 2**

```
| | | | |
|X| | | |
|X| | | |
|X|O|O|X|
|X|O|O|X|
---------
|4|0|0|2|
```

In the following actions, we will always ignore this part of water.

**Step 3**

```
| | | | | | | |
|X| | | | | | |
|X| | | | | |X|
|X|O|O|X| | |X|
|X|O|O|X| | |X|
---------------
|4|0|0|2|0|0|3|
```

Then we encounter another elevation `3`. In this case we first fill in water bwtween gap `2` and `3` first.

**Step 4**

```
| | | | | | | |
|X| | | | | | |
|X| | | | | |X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|
---------------
|4|0|0|2|0|0|3|
```

We fill in water between gap `2` and `3`. We will always ignore this part of water in the following action.

Then we fill in water between gap `4` and `3`. As we IGNORED water between gap `4` and `2` which is done in step (2), we will only fill in water above elevation `2`.

**Step 5**

```
| | | | | | | |
|X| | | | | | |
|X|O|O|O|O|O|X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|
---------------
|4|0|0|2|0|0|3|
```

Now we fill in all water between gap `4` and `3`. We will always ignore this part of water in the following action.

**Step 6**

```
| | | | | | | | | |X|
|X| | | | | | | | |X|
|X|O|O|O|O|O|X| | |X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X| | |X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X| | |X|
---------------------
|4|0|0|2|0|0|3|0|0|5|
```

Now we encounter elevation `5`. We will first fill in water between gap `3` and `5`.

**Step 7**

```
| | | | | | | | | |X|
|X| | | | | | | | |X|
|X|O|O|O|O|O|X|O|O|X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|
---------------------
|4|0|0|2|0|0|3|0|0|5|
```

We fill in water between gap `3` and `5`. We will always ignore this part of water in the following action.

Then we fill in water between gap `4` and `5`. As we IGNORED water between `4` and `3` which is done in step (5), we will only fill in water above elevation `3`.

**Step 8**

```
| | | | | | | | | |X|
|X|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|X|
|X|O|O|O|O|O|X|O|O|X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|
---------------------
|4|0|0|2|0|0|3|0|0|5|
```

We fill in water between gap `4` and `5`. As elevation `5` is higher then `4`, we will ignore the entire part in the following action.

**Step 9**

```
| | | | | | | | | |X| | | |
|X|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|X| | | |
|X|O|O|O|O|O|X|O|O|X| | |X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|O|O|X| | |X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|O|O|X| | |X|
---------------------------
|4|0|0|2|0|0|3|0|0|5|0|0|3|
```

We encounter elevation `3`. Fill in water between gap `5` and `3`.

**Step 10**

```
| | | | | | | | | |X| | | |
|X|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|X| | | |
|X|O|O|O|O|O|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|
|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|O|O|X|
---------------------------
|4|0|0|2|0|0|3|0|0|5|0|0|3|
```

We fill in water between gap `5` and `3`. As we IGNORED water before elevation `5` in step (8), we are done filling water.

In conclude, we will be filling water following below instructions:

1. If the current elevation is lower than or equals to the last elevation, `current_height <= stack[-1].height`,

   we will just fill in the gap and ignore this part in the following actions;

2. If the current elevation is higher then the last elevation, but lower than any of the previous elevations, `current_height > stack[-1].height and current_height < stack[0].height` (0 can also be any index in the stack),

   we will fill in all the gaps between current elevation and those elevations that are lower or equals to current elevation for each elevation, and ignore all the filled gap in the following actions;

3. If the current elevation is higher than all the other previous elevations, `current_height > stack[0].height`,

   we will fill in all the gaps for each elevation, and ignore the entire part in the following actions.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        # stack will store a data structure of (height, index)
        stack, result = [], 0

        for i in range(len(height)):
            mid = 0

            # when there are previous elevations
            while stack:
                h, j  = stack[-1]
                width = i - j - 1

                if h <= height[i]:
                    result += (h - mid) * width
                    # to ignore filled water in the following steps
                    mid = h
                    # pop to "unsee" filled gap in the following steps
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    result += (height[i] - mid) * width
                    break

            stack.append((height[i], i))

        return result
```
